<h2>Context and objective</h2>
<p>
There is no questioning, nowadays, the importance of Knowledge Graphs, for building insight from the overwhelming abundance of data produced by organizations and their environment.
There is much debate, on the other hand, about what the best tools are to build such Knowledge Graphs.
Semantic Graphs, based on RDF and the principles of Linked Data, rely on solid theoretical foundations for reasoning with ontologies, and on IRIs and shared vocabularies for Web scale interoperability.
Property Graphs, as implemented in a number of commercial and open-source systems, provide a flexible and intuitive data model, coupled with efficient traversal-based query languages and analytics tools.

<p>
The goal of this workshop is to report and share experiences from industry and academia, on using, comparing, and bridging the gap between these two kinds of graphs.
The expected outcome is a better understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two paradigms, and the emergence of tools and methods allowing to get the best of both worlds.
